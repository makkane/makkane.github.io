Hi Anup,

I got to know about you from Bhanu who is doing Ph.D. here at KTH. He met you on a few occasions in meetings.
I am writing to apply for a suitable position at InMotion.

I am a postdoctoral fellow at KTH. I am working on electromagnetic compatibility aspects of solar PV installations. I have workedon interdisciplinary project in power electronics during my Ph.D. 

Moreover, I have worked in Engineering Research Center of Tata Motors Ltd. for four years. I was technical lead of motor design where I worked to develop various drive solution for hybrid and electric vehicles.
