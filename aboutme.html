<p>नमस्ते!   Hi! Hej!
			I am Makarand M Kane. 			<br>
			I come from a small town - <a href = "https://goo.gl/maps/WRaVpqPk7VEeQ4DV8" target="_blank"> Chiplun</a> - on the west coast of India, in Maharashtra state. <br>
			After attending high school in Chiplun, I moved to <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pune" target="_blank"> Pune</a> - the automotive, cultural, and educational hub of Maharashtra - for my college and university education. <br>
			I completed higher education in <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai" target="_blank"> Mumbai </a> - at <a href = "https://www.iitb.ac.in/" target="_blank">Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay</a>. Pune was also a workplace for me as I was working at Engineering Research Center of <a href = "www.tatamotors.com" target = "_blank"> Tata Motors Ltd</a>.

			For initial part of my career I worked on electrical machines - their design and diagnostics. For my Ph.D. I worked on a completely different topic of "Wire Electric Discharge Machining". Presently, I am working on Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) issues in Solar Photovoltaics (solar PV).
